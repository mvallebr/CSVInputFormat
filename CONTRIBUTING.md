# Contributing to this project

First, thanks for your time in contributing to this repo. 

I created this nearly when hadoop 2 had been launched and at that time, it was quite useful.

I have left that project for long now, but as I see people are still using this and contributing to this, I have added a TRAVIS CI pipeline running docker for validating pull requests.

When you submit a PR, `.travis.yml` scripts are going to be executed, so please make sure you execute them locally and see they are passing before submitting the PR. 

Also, please not this project has less tests than it should, so contributing with more tests would be very welcome! Please consider using TDD and adding a test for your contribution before submitting any modifications to the source, all users of this repo will be thankful and your confidence in using it will as well.
